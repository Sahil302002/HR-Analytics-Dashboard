    - Slicers for filtering data by department, education level, or age group.
    - Drill-down and cross-filtering options to analyze specific trends.
2. **Real-time Insights**:
    - Automatically updated visuals and metrics when data is refreshed.
3. **Interactive Visualizations**:
    - Tools like tooltips, drill-throughs, and filters provide in-depth insights.
4. **Custom Calculations**:
    - Used **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to calculate attrition rates, average age, and other key metrics dynamically.

    - Employees with a **Bachelor’s Degree** exhibit the highest attrition (99 individuals).
    - Master's Degree and Associate Degree holders also show significant attrition.
    - Doctoral Degree holders have the least attrition (5 individuals).
3. **Age-wise Distribution of Employees (Stacked Bar Chart)**
    - Most employees fall in the **25–34 age group** (337 males, 217 females).
    - Attrition is notably high for this age group, with 112 employees leaving.
4. **Job Satisfaction Rating (Heatmap)**
    - **Research Scientists** have the highest satisfaction overall (292 employees).
    - **Sales Executives** exhibit the highest dissatisfaction, as reflected by a higher count of ratings 1 and 2.
5. **Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups (Donut Charts)**
    - Under 25: male attrition (53%) is slightly higher than  female attrition (47%).
    - 25–34: male attrition is 62%, indicating potential dissatisfaction or other challenges.
    - 35–44: Male attrition dominates (73%), suggesting challenges in retaining mid-career male employees.
    - Above 45: Attrition rates drop significantly, indicating better retention for senior employees.
6. **Insight from the Slicer**:
    - By selecting a specific education level, HR can identify trends and patterns unique to that group. For example:
    - Attrition for Bachelor's Degree holders is the highest, and filtering further can pinpoint specific departments or age groups contributing to this.
    - Master's Degree holders show significant attrition as well, which might indicate unmet career expectations for highly qualified employees.

    - Offer training and development programs to Laboratory Technicians to improve morale and job satisfaction.
3. **Support Younger Employees**:
    - Implement career development programs and skill-building workshops for employees aged 25–34.
    - Consider flexible work arrangements or perks for this group to enhance retention.
4. **Address Gender-specific Challenges**:
